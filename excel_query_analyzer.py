        SHEET MAPPING STRATEGY:

        2. If original plan and high impact sheets are available then directly map the original sheet's placement with te high impact
        placement, that for this plan this will be the high impact plan.
        3. If original and combined sheets are available then compare the placement names of both sheets and the placement names present
        only in the combined sheets are the high imapct packages, map them to the original plan.
        4. Somethimes the combined sheet will contain all the same placement names as in original sheet but they will increase the net 
        cost of placements in it.
